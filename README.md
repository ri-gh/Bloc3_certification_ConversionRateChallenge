# Bloc3_certification_ConversionRateChallenge
Supervised ML project about conversion rate / Logistic regression

www.datascienceweekly.org is a famous newsletter curated by independent data scientists.
Anyone can register his/her e-mail address on this website to receive weekly news about data science and its applications !


They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter).

To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the f1-score

To complete this project, your team should:

Create some relevant figures for EDA

Train at least one model that predicts the conversions and evaluate its performances (f1, confusion matrices)

Make at least one submission to the leaderboard

Analyze your best model's parameters and try to make some recommendations to improve the conversion rate in the future


The 2 files to train and test models are conversion_data_train.csv & conversion_data_test.csv
